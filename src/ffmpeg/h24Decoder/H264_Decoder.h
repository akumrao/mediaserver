/*

  H264_Decoder
  ---------------------------------------

  Example that shows how to use the libav parser system. This class forces a 
  H264 parser and codec. You use it by opening a file that is encoded with x264 
  using the `load()` function. You can pass the framerate you want to use for playback.
  If you don't pass the framerate, we will detect it as soon as the parser found 
  the correct information.

  After calling load(), you can call readFrame() which will read a new frame when
  necessary. It will also make sure that it will read enough data from the buffer/file
  when there is not enough data in the buffer.

  `readFrame()` will trigger calls to the given `h264_decoder_callback` that you pass
  to the constructor.
